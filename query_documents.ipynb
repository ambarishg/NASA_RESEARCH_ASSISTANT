       "') algorithms for Gleason grading have been developed and validated using expert-provided Gleason scores.9â€“12 However, an evaluation of the prognostic value of these algorithms and a direct comparison to the prognostic value of Gleason grading provided by pathologists has not been conducted\\n---\\n Furthermore, qualitative analysis of algorithm and pathologist discordances suggests several ways in which the algorithmic grading and pathologist grading may be complementary, including consistent grading of regions by the AI which may be variably overgraded by pathologists, or identification of small, high grade regions which may otherwise be missed by pathologists.

The deep learning architecture for the Gleason grading model is detailed in prior work10. All survival analyses were conducted using Lifelines42, an open source Python library. References 1.
